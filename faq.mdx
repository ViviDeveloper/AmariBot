# **AmariBot - FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) 🧋**

---

## 🏹 **General Setup Questions**

### 🧸 **The bot isn't responding to me! What should I do?**
- **Permissions Issue**: Ensure that the bot has the `Send Messages` and `Embed Links` permissions in the channel you want it to respond in.
- **Prefix Change**: You may have changed the bot's prefix and forgotten. Try pinging the bot with `@AmariBot` to find out the current prefix.
- **Default Prefix Issue**: Ensure you're typing the correct prefix (`:?`) if you haven't customized it.

### 🍩 **How do I change the bot’s prefix?**
You can change the bot’s prefix using:
plaintext
:?prefix <new prefix>

For example, if you want to set the prefix to !, use:

```bash
    :?prefix !
   ```

🧁 How do I make the bot give roles at certain levels?

Use the :?rlevel command to set up roles that are given when a user reaches a certain level:

```bash
:?rlevel add <level> <@role>
   ```


**Example:**

```bash
:?rlevel add 5 @EpicRole
   ```


## 🔧 Leveling & Role Management

🧺 How does the leveling system work?

Users gain XP by participating in the server. Once they reach certain XP thresholds, they level up. When a user reaches a level that has an associated role, they will receive the role automatically. This is configured via the :?rlevel system.

5️⃣ How do I change the XP rate?

The default XP rate is 1 XP per message. If you’d like to change it, use the following command to set custom multipliers:

:?pmulti set <1-100>

This allows you to adjust the XP rate for your entire server.

🧸 Custom Announcements

6️⃣ How do I set up custom level-up announcements?

You can set custom announcements using the :?announce command:

:?announce custom <text>

Example:

:?announce custom CONGRATS! You are now level {level}!!!

To set custom announcements for specific levels:

:?announce level add <level> <text>

To remove custom announcements for a level:

:?announce level remove <level>

🔒 Blacklist and Multipliers

7️⃣ How do I blacklist channels or roles from gaining XP?

You can prevent certain channels or roles from earning XP by using the :?blacklist command:

:?blacklist add #channel
:?blacklist add @role

To see all blacklisted channels and roles:

8️⃣ How do I set different XP rates for channels or roles?

You can use the :?pmulti command to set custom multipliers:

:?pmulti set <1-100>

For specific channels or roles:

:?pmulti add #channel 5
:?pmulti add @role 10

To remove a multiplier:

:?pmulti remove #channel
